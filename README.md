Arduino-snippets
================

This repository contains snippets, photo and notes collected during development on Arduino platform, right from very first basic steps.

**BasicUartComm** : Basic program that receives single characters from UART-RX and echo them to UART-TX. This is a skeleton program used to build other more complex programs which need receiving command from user and providing logging.

**BasicI2c** : Based on the BasicUartComm skeleton, at present implements I2C interface setup through Wire library and initiate a transmission.
